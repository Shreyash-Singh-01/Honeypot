# Honeypot
A lightweight multi-protocol honeypot framework built in Python that simulates SSH and HTTP login services to capture and analyze malicious authentication attempts.  This project is designed for security research, intrusion detection, and attacker behavior analysis, while safely logging attacker activity for later investigation.
